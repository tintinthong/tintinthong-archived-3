Hi, my name is Justin. I am a data engineer with goals to: 

1. Learn more about technology 
2. Build software at a high frequency 

I program primarily in Javascript, R and Haskell. I am also an avid Vimster with a deep desire to emancipate myself from VS Code. Currently, I am building infrastructure to support an adaptive learning engine in Haskell and Javascript.  

 The main reason I start this blog is for self-reference, therefore, pardon me for amateurishly-edited articles. I will try my best to  maintain my articles such that it is effective and shareable. If you find my content and code interesting, please do message me feedback or submit an issue.

If you have visited my previous site, you will have noticed that I have changed my layout; I ported my site from Jekyll to Elm-Static. I did it (partially) because I wanted to experiment with some Elm, but, mostly to make a more content-centric site. My previous site was filled with cards and meta data about my Github repo which was unnecessary.

I am truly happy you are here so let me leave you with a Rick-and-Morty-esque mind-teaser. 

### Question

Jerry works out-of-state. In order to get home, his journey consists of a train journey and a car journey. On a typical work day, Jerry's train usually reaches the station at 5 pm. His wife, Beth, drives a car to the station to pick him up at the very exact same time. Beth is very consistent: she drives the car at a constant speed and always gets Jerry home at the same time every day.

One day, Jerry was able to leave work early. He took an earlier train that arrived at the station at 4pm, however, he forgot to inform Beth that he would be early. Since he was impatient to wait, he decided to just walk home and meet his wife at some point in the middle.

Assuming that they arrived home 10 minutes earlier than usual, how long was Jerry walking for?
