I am a data engineer at Vase.ai, a market analytics platform that collects insights through automated delivery of surveys to the mass market. My background was not in engineering; I read mathematics and statistics at the University of St Andrews. In my previous job I did data science for 4 months before moving to business operations for 1 year. Software engineering was always something I wanted to pursue. It is not until recently that I found the inner courage to make a full-on transition. 

I program primarily in Javascript, R and Haskell. My developer tools comprise of Vim, tmux and VSCode. I am a user of functional programming paradigms (if you noticed I moved my previous site from Ruby to Elm). I carefully selected the word "user" to avoid people from thinking that I am an evangelist like most haskellers. I do, however, believe that people should use R for data science. R is an amazing domain-specific language. There are no clear reasons why people should prefer Python over R (for data science). A lot of data-related packages in Python take inspiration from R too.

This blog functions as a place for me to share my knowledge and discoveries (also as a self-referencing notebook). If you are interested in my ideas or software, please leave feedback or submit an issue on Github.
