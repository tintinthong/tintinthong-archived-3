Hi, my name is Justin. I am a data engineer with goals to: 

1. Improve my reasoning about technologies
2. Build and develop software 

I program in R, Javascript and Haskell (in order of descending comfort) If you have visited my previous site, you will have noticed that I have changed my layout; I basically ported my site from Jekyll to Elm-Static. The reasons for this is: 1) I am making a transition into building software under a stricter functional paradigm so I wanted to experiment with some Elm, 2) My previous site had a large focus on my GitHub repos. I wanted to make this site more content-centric.

What is my development workflow you ask? I spend a lot of time setting-up my work environment in Vim + Tmux. Yes, I am a Vimster. I have centralised a lot of my workflow to the Vim by using stuff like Vimium. I often tell people that if I develop for 1 hour, 5 minutes is usually dedicated to improving my vim config. I guess I enjoy it!  It is my hope one day that I will not need to rely on VS Code for development (yet to come).  

The main reason I start this blog is mainly for my self-reference, therefore, pardon me for amateurishly-edited articles. Hopefully, I can maintain my articles to the level that is shareable for other peoples learning. If you find my content and code interesting, please do message me feedback or submit an issue.
