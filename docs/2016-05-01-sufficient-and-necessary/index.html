<p>Let me offer you a good example. This example explains the difference between these two conditions. We all understand 4-point scale GPA. Educational institutions (USA in particular) use GPA to justify if someone is eligible for a sports scholarship <a href="https://www.athleticscholarships.net/question/minimum-gpa-to-get-a-scholarship">(in link)</a>. </p>
<ul>
<li>A student will need at least a 2.0. to be eligible for a sports scholarship,</li>
</ul>
<p>Jim is a 7-ft high school basketball player and he has a GPA of 3.0. He works day and night in seek of a scholarship because his parents are financially incapable of paying for his education in full. Months after applying, just as he is setting off on his new journey,  he finds out that he is not offered a scholarship. OH BOY! Jim was furious with the outcome. He thought that a GPA of 3.0 would automatically give him the right to claim a scholarship. Instead, a GPA of at least 2.0 was only a NECESSARY CONDITION.</p>
<p>His hard work and persistence in his studies offered him a 4.0 GPA.  to take a low-interest loan from a non-profit that he was supporting. He also manages  to get 20% discount off his school fees. </p>
<ul>
<li>A student with a 4.0 GPA will graduate with Phi Beta Kappa Honours. </li>
</ul>
<p>His hardwork and persistence scored him a 4.0 GPA.  Although Jim did not continue to play basketball professionally, he got into Phi Beta Kappa – the most prestigious honor society in the world! PHEW! This time Jim was not surprised because a 4.0 GPA was a SUFFICIENT CONDITION to be admitted into Phi Beta Kappa. </p>
<p>Get the difference?</p>
<h2 id="necessary-and-sufficient-conditions">NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT CONDITIONS</h2>
<p>Here is the the definition of necessary and sufficient conditions. Let P and Q be statements that are either true or false. </p>
<ul>
<li>IF P IS NECESSARY FOR Q, THEN Q CANNOT BE TRUE UNLESS P IS TRUE.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>IF [a GPA above 2.0] IS NECESSARY FOR [a sports scholarship], THEN [ a sports scholarship] CANNOT BE TRUE UNLESS [a GPA above 2.0] IS TRUE.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>IF P IS SUFFICIENT FOR Q, THEN P IMPLIES Q</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>IF [a GPA of 4.0] IS SUFFICIENT FOR [admittence into Phi Beta Kappa], THEN [a GPA of 4.0] IMPLIES [admittence into Phi Beta Kappa].</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- i.e. $Q \rightarrow P$ -->
<!-- , i.e. $P \rightarrow Q$ -->
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Being a human is a sufficient condition for being a mammal. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Being a warm-blooded is a necessary condition for being human. But warm-bloodedness does not mean that you are human. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Dying is a necessary condition for being human. If you are human, you will have to die one day, but just because you will die one day does not mean that you are human. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>But, there are  certain complexities that these conditions do not cover. For example, sufficient but not necessary conditions; and, necessary but not sufficient conditions. For example, being warm-blooded and dying are necessary conditions to be human. Since lions also are warm-blooded and eventually die (not only humans), they cannot be sufficient conditions. Can you find an example that a condition is sufficient but not necessary? Can you find an example that is both sufficient and necessary?</p>
<p>Additionally, you will notice that necessary and sufficient conditions are complements of one another. For example,  if P is a necessary condition for Q, then Q is a sufficient condition for P. But, does it work the other way round? (If P is a sufficient condition for Q, that DOES NOT MEAN Q is a necessary condition for P)  </p>
<!-- >! Being a sheep is a sufficient condition for being an animal. But, being an animal is not a necessary condition for being a sheep.  -->

## Proving sqrt(2) is irrational

If you have ever spent any time learning mathematics, you will learn that clarity and unambiguity are essential. One cannot claim the fact of "the square root of 2 is irrational without a clear reasoning process". Here, we compare three different statements and what they mean.

1. The square root of 2 is irrational. 
2. The square root of 2 is irrational if it is not rational
3. The square root of 2 is irrational if it cannot be expressed as a fraction. 

1) is a blatant statement of what the truth is; mostly, eliciting a question of why it is true. Any type of thought will pursue this questioning. It follows that 2) and 3) exists because of the incompleteness of statement 1 (each are conditional statements).

Notice that 1) 2) 3) are in ascending order of detail. My question is: Are any of these statements the same?--> 
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>When I first discovered necessary and sufficient conditions. I thought that if something was sufficient that would mean it was necessary. I realised that my pre-conceived notion led me astray. Whether communicating conditions for a scholarship or conditions for claim a tax rebate, we must be mindful of what we are saying. These concepts flood over to fields of science, public policy and even god. Thus, it is necessary. </p>
